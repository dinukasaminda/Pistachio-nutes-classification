## Pistachio Image Dataset

This study focuses on enhancing the economic value of pistachio nuts through improved post-harvest processes, particularly by developing a classification model for different pistachio species. Given that various species cater to different markets, efficient separation and classification methods are essential. The researchers created a computer vision system that utilizes image processing and artificial intelligence to distinguish between two pistachio species. They collected 2,148 high-resolution images and applied techniques such as segmentation and feature extraction to develop a dataset with sixteen attributes. An advanced k-NN classifier, combined with principal component analysis, was implemented, resulting in a classification accuracy of 94.18%. This model not only addresses the classification of pistachio species but also has broader applications in similar fields, thereby potentially increasing the economic value of the species.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 2,148 high-resolution images of pistachio nuts. The images were collected from two different species of pistachio nuts, namely, Ak√ßatepe and Siirt. we are only focusing on the classification of these two species by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
